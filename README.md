      we ran a Logistic Regression that tries to predict whether the stock price will go up or down, but not by how much.
      Instead of using the actual prices (the magnitude of the prices, both for the fuel and the stock
      changes over time), we used the price changes.Their was no corrilation in tha data so any linear regression wasnt gonna work well.
      we were going to make a prediction using  Classification report but Classification algorithms can't produce continuous predictions.
      Price changes for the stock were categorized as 1s and 0s (like in the Algo Trading module), and 
      the jet fuel price changes were used as the predictors.
